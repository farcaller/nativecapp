NativeCapp is an attempt to make a better approach to running Cappuccino alongside the native OS applications.

To build NativeCapp you must have Qt 4.7, a beta release.

NativeCapp supports minimal command line options:
 -d enables debug mode (index-debug.html is the default target, web inspector
    is enabled)
 -a <APP_INDEX> allows you to run arbitrary html file as the NativeCapp target

By default NativeCapp expects you to bundle the Cappuccino application and the
framework into Qt resourse bundle (i.e. without any options NativeCapp loads
qrc:/index.html or qrc:/index-debug.html if debug is enabled). To simplify
the process of packing Cappuccino and application code you can use makeqrc.py
script. It's syntax is pretty straightforward:

  ./makeqrc.py /path/to/directory/where/index.html/resides output.qrc

Don't forget to modify NativeCapp.pro by adding the following line:

  RESOURCES += output.qrc

The software is in very early stages, so expect it to be broken, features
appearing and disappearing and other strange issues. Your feedback is welcome.
